# An investigation of offline reinforcement learning in factorisable action spaces

This repository contains the code and datasets used to produce the results in our paper - link pending.

Installation and download instructions for the DMC benchmark datasets can be accessed [here](https://github.com/davidireland3/dmc_datasets). 

The algorithms used in the work can be found in the folder "Algorithms".

Installation instructions for the Maze environment can be found [here](https://github.com/yashchandak/lifelong_changing_actions).

## Instructions for running code
We provide individual examples of running each algorithm for one set of Maze and DMC datasets.  To train on a different dataset, simply update the environment parameters and file location.  Be sure to update expert and random scores as well as the number of sub-action dimensions.

A full list of expert and random scores is available in the file "Expert_Random_Scores.csv"

## Feedback 
If you experience any problems or have any queries, please raise an issue or pull request.
